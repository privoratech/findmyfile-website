    <h1>FindMyFile Account Deletion Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 19, 2025</p>

    <p>This page explains how you can request the deletion of your FindMyFile account and all associated data.</p>

    <h2>How to Request Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can request the deletion of your account directly from within the FindMyFile app:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the FindMyFile app and navigate to the settings screen (by clicking "Select Folders to Search").</li>
        <li>Tap the <strong>"Delete My Account"</strong> button.</li>
        <li>A confirmation dialog will appear, explaining that this action is permanent and will cancel any active subscription.</li>
        <li>Confirm your choice to submit the deletion request.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
    <p>Once your request is submitted, your account will be added to a deletion queue. The final deletion will be processed in a batch within 24-48 hours. The following data will be permanently removed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account from Firebase Authentication (including email and login credentials).</li>
        <li>Your user document from our database, which includes your subscription status and expiry date.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This action cannot be undone.</p>
